   many times, `- m C-x z z z ...' is handy.)

 * Bongo is now able to display various kinds of icons.
   It ships with a set of icons from the GNOME project.
   See the following variables and their containing groups:

     - `bongo-display-track-icons'
     - `bongo-display-header-icons'
     - `bongo-track-mark-icon-file-name'

 * All backends now support pausing.  Non-interactive backend
   players are paused and resumed using SIGSTOP and SIGCONT.
   In particular, this means that pausing and resuming is now
   available for ogg123, speexdec, TiMidity and MikMod.
