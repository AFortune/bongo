Bongo NEWS file listing user-visible changes.

April 28, 2007

 * Inline playback progress is now disabled by default,
   because it slowed down seeking.  To turn it back on,
   customize `bongo-display-inline-playback-progress'.

 * Left-clicking the arrow buttons in the mode line now
   fast-forwards or rewinds instead of switching tracks ---
   to switch tracks, use the right mouse button (`mouse-3').

 * The arrow buttons will now only appear during playback
   (leaving just the play button when playback is stopped).

   To pick your own set of mode line buttons, customize the
   variable `bongo-mode-line-indicator-format'.

April 27, 2007

 * The keys in seek mode have changed a little.  It used to
   be that `f' and `b' each sought one second, while `M-f'
   and `M-b' sought ten seconds.  Here are the new keys:

    - One second: `C-f', `C-b', `F', `B'
    - Three seconds: `f', `b', `<left>', `<right>'
    - Ten seconds: `M-f', `M-b', `M-<left>', `M-<right>'
    - One minute: `C-M-f', `C-M-b'

   Some other keys in this keymap changed as well, but I
   don't think any of it is worth mentioning.

April 26, 2007

 * Playback progress is now shown directly in the playlist
   buffer using the `bongo-elapsed-track-part' face (which
   by default looks like the `bongo-played-track' face).

 * Track lengths are now displayed in playlist buffers.
   You may want to customize `bongo-track-length-column' or
   (to disable this feature) `bongo-display-track-lengths'.

   [This feature is still rather experimental and probably
   does not work the way we will ultimately want it to.]

April 11, 2007

 * There is a new binding for playing stuff: `g'.  It plays
   the next N tracks, given a prefix argument N, or the
   tracks in the region, if the region is active, or the
   marked tracks, if any, or the track at point otherwise.

   The `RET' command is unchanged; it still plays the track
   under point, or the next N tracks with a prefix argument.
   (Note that `RET' never plays, e.g., all marked tracks.)

April 10, 2007

 * You may now bring up a context menu of useful commands by
   right-clicking a track line or section header.  Try it!

April 9, 2007

 * Bongo now displays any metadata provided by streaming
   media servers (such as what's currently being played).
   This is enabled by default but only available for VLC.

April 5, 2007

 * Bongo Sprinkle mode now sets `bongo-mark-played-tracks',
   and the default value is now `nil' (it used to be `t').
   Enabling Sprinkle mode sets it to `t' buffer-locally.

 * Stopping a track being played using `C-c C-s' will now
   not mark it as played; but `C-c C-n' and `C-c C-p' will.

April 4, 2007

 * The new Bongo Sprinkle mode is an alternative to random
   playback, based on the idea of automatically _enqueuing_
   random tracks instead of playing tracks in random order.
   To try it, run `M-x bongo-sprinkle-mode' in a playlist.

 * The various commands beginning with `i' are no longer
   bound to any keys.  Instead, there is a general `i'
   command for inserting files and directories, and another
   command `I' for inserting special things.  Unfortunately,
   this currently includes URIs (use `I u RET').

 * Commands that operate on the marked tracks now kill the
   current marking after using it.  Use `* y' to restore the
   last marking, or `* k' to manually kill the current one.
   Killing a marking discards the previously killed one ---
   in the future, there might be a stack of killed markings.

   The handy command `* *' toggles between some marking and
   the blank marking by killing or yanking as appropriate.
   Thus, `% m Dylan RET e * *' enqueues all tracks matching
   the string "Dylan" and then restores the marking of them.
   Typing `* *' another time gets rid of the marking again.

March 18, 2007

 * You can now specify which backend to use for individual
   tracks using `M-x bongo-set-backend-for-track'.

February 25, 2007

 * The `M' command is gone.  Use `- m' instead.  (To do it
   many times, `- m C-x z z z ...' is handy.)

 * The `g' command is gone.  Use `M-x bongo-redisplay'.

February 12, 2007

 * Bongo is now able to display various kinds of icons.
   It ships with a set of icons from the GNOME project.
   See the following variables and their containing groups:

     - `bongo-display-track-icons'
     - `bongo-display-header-icons'
     - `bongo-track-mark-icon-file-name'

February 8, 2007

 * All backends now support pausing.  Non-interactive backend
   players are paused and resumed using SIGSTOP and SIGCONT.
   In particular, this means that pausing and resuming is now
   available for ogg123, speexdec, TiMidity and MikMod.
