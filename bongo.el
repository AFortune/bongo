MATCHER can be t, nil, a string, a list, or a symbol;

CONSTRUCTOR is a function that recieves one argument, FILE-NAME.
  It should immediately start a player for FILE-NAME.

This list names the possible keys of a type of alist called an infoset.
The value of a field may be some arbitrarily complex data structure,
but the name of each field must be a simple symbol.

By default, each field consists of another alist:
 * the `artist' field consists of a single mandatory `name' subfield;
 * the `album' field consists of both a mandatory `title' subfield
   and an optional `year' subfield; and finally,
 * the `track' field consists of a mandatory `title' subfield
   and an optional `index' subfield.

Currently, this list needs to be completely ordered, starting with
the most general field and ending with the most specific field.
This restriction may be relaxed in the future to either allow partially
ordered field lists, or to abandon the hard-coded ordering completely.

The meaning and content of the fields are defined implicitly by the
functions that use and operate on fields and infosets (sets of fields).
