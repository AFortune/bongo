;;; Todo:

;; Streaming media support.

;; Shuffle operations.  It would be nice to have both a
;; random shuffle operation and an interleaving
;; enqueue operation.

;; Fix `E' when the playing song is not in the playlist.

;; Customizing `bongo-header-line-mode' should have
;; immediate effect on existing Bongo playlist buffers.

;; Fix strange race condition related to pausing.

Entries are rules of the form (BACKEND-NAME . MATCHER).

BACKEND-NAME is either `ignore' (which tells Bongo to ignore
  the matched files), or a symbol naming the backend to use.
MATCHER specifies which files the rule applies to;
  it is given to `bongo-file-name-matches-p'.

This option overrides `bongo-enabled-backends' in that disabled
backends will still be used if these rules say so.  In addition,
it always takes precedence over `bongo-backend-matchers'.

For example, let's say that you want to use mplayer instead of
mpg123 to play MP3 files, use speexdec to play \".speex\" files
in addition to \".spx\" files, and ignore WAV files altogether.
Then you could use the following setting:

 * the `artist' field consists of a single mandatory `name' subfield;
 * the `album' field consists of both a mandatory `title' subfield
   and an optional `year' subfield; and finally,
 * the `track' field consists of a mandatory `title' subfield
   and an optional `index' subfield.

Currently, this list needs to be completely ordered, starting with
the most general field and ending with the most specific field.
This restriction may be relaxed in the future to either allow partially
ordered field lists, or to abandon the hard-coded ordering completely.

The meaning and content of the fields are defined implicitly by the
functions that use and operate on fields and infosets (sets of fields).
Therefore, if you change this list, you probably also need to change
 (a) either `bongo-infoset-formatting-function' or
     `bongo-field-formatting-function',
 (b) `bongo-infoset-from-file-name-function', and
 (c) either `bongo-file-name-from-infoset-function' or
     `bongo-file-name-part-from-field-function'."

general but not specific data.  For example, it cannot
represent ((artist (name \"Foo\"))), because a file name
